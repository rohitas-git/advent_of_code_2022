# Context

Supplies are stored in stacks of marked crates, but because the needed supplies are buried under many other crates, the crates need to be rearranged.

Crates can moved between stacks
After the crates are rearranged, the desired crates will be at the top of each stack
No idea which crate will end up where
Crates are moved one at a time

Input: A drawing of the starting stacks of crates and the rearrangement procedure

 1   2   3 

move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1

## Part 1

Find: After the rearrangement procedure completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?

## Part 2

The new crane has the ability to pick up and move multiple crates at once.
This result in moved crates staying in the same order
