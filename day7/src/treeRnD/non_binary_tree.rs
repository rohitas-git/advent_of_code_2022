///  Impl Details
/// - a reference to a parent that it does not own, but has a weak reference to
/// - hold references to children that it owns

// Therefore, need to Handle:
// Shared ownership (Rc) - necessary to optimally provide access to these children node to other code that use this tree data structure.
// Interior mutability (RefCell) - necessary to allow modifications to the underlying node itself.

// THREAD SAFETY #
// While this is a good start, we haven‚Äôt dealt with thread safety.
// Rust makes it very easy to handle this paralellism, we simply do the following:
// - Replace Rc with Arc.
// - Replace RefCell with RwLock (note that we could have also used Mutex but we are using RwLock for better performance in use cases where more nodes will be accessed in the tree, rather than new nodes added to the tree).

// !!!!! SOPHISTICATED APPROACH USING MEMORY ARENA
// In our naive example, we manage references that are strong (owned, children) and weak (not owned, parent). And we have to wrap the NodeData inside of a Node in order to be able to share it. This is quite cumbersome to use. We will use the idea of a memory arena to simplify this. Here‚Äôs the wikipedia definition of a memory arena.

// ! TRAITS

// They are meant for 2 things:
// 1. Extension of existing types -
// 2. Adaptation of existing types -
